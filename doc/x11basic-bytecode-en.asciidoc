== Description of the bytecode file format.

The ending is usually .b.


=== Header
The file starts with a 40 bytes header. All values are little endian.

|=======
|*offset*|*type*|*content*| *purpose*
|0x00| byte  | 0x11       |  magic byte 1
|0x01| byte  | 0x26       |  magic byte 2
|0x02| short | 0x0000     |  not used (reserved)
|0x04| int   | 0x........ |  size of the text/code segment
|0x08| int   | 0x........ |  size of the readonly data segment
|0x0C| int   | 0x........ |  size of the data segment for DATA statements
|0x10| int   | 0x........ |  size of the data segment
|0x14| int   | 0x........ |  storage space for variables
|0x18| int   | 0x........ |  size of the symbol table segment
|0x1C| int   | 0x........ |  size of the string segment 
|0x20| int   | 0x........ |  size of the relocation data
|0x24| short | 0x0000     |  not used (reservd)
|0x26| short | 0x1274     |  version 1.27/4
|=======

The file format can be identified by evaluating the first two bytes together 
with the version information. The Version information is in BCD and can be
read as

----
 0xGHIJ --> "Version G.HI/J"
----


Compatibility is also determined by version: It the version differs, the 
bytecode is incompatible and should not be excecuted.

=== text/code segment

In this segment the bytecode itself is stored.

===  readonly data segment

===  data segment for DATA statements

===  data segment

===  space for variables
So-called block storage segment. 

===  symbol table segment

===  string segment 

===  relocation data
