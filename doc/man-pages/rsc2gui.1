.SH DESCRIPTION

X11-Basic is a dialect of the BASIC programming language with graphics.

X11-Basic uses a graphical user interface (GUI) which is very similar to the
ATARI-ST TOS/GEM implementation. The *.gui file format, which is basically an
ASCII representation of the ATARI-ST recource files (*.rsc), can be converted to
X11-Basic code, which then can handle message boxes and forms. (see 
.I gui2bas(1)\fR.

.B rsc2gui
can be used to convert ATARI ST recource files to *.gui files.
