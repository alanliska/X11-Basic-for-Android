.SH DESCRIPTION

X11-Basic is a dialect of the BASIC programming language with graphics
capability that integrates features like shell scripting, cgi-Programming and 
full graphical visualisation into the easy to learn basic language on modern 
computers.

The syntax is most similar to the old GFA-Basic ATARI ST implementation. Old
GFA-programs should run with only few changes. Also DOS/QBASIC programmers will
feel comfortable.

Ancient ANSI-Basic programs (with line numbers) can be converted to X11-Basic 
with the 
.I bas2x11basic 
program (see the man page 
.I bas2x11basic(1)
).

.B xbasic 
is the interpreter. It interpretes basic command-files (programs), which 
usually have the extension .bas or .xbas.
It can also run in interactive mode in which case it interpretes single lines of
code, which are entered.
.B xbasic 
can also interpret and run bytecode files, which have been compiled 
before from .bas programs via the 
.I xbbc(1) 
bytecode compiler.

For detailed help and description of the implemented basic commands take a look
at the README file which comes with the X11-Basic package. There is also a full
users manual available as *.pdf file on the homepage.

.SH INTERACTIVE USE
If no options are given on the command line, 
.B xbasic
will run interactivly.

A prompt will be displayed and any command can be typed in. It will be excecuted
immediately after pressing return or enter. The input is buffered and can be
edited using the up and down arrows on the keyboard.

.B To quit the program
simply enter 
.IR quit
or press 
.IR CTRL-C.

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
xbasic testme.bas
xbasic testme.b
xbasic -e 'alert 1,"Hello world !",1," OK ",b'
xbasic --eval 1+3-4*3
xbasic --help "*nl*"
.fi

You can find additional sample programs in 
.I /usr/share/doc/packages/X11Basic/examples.

.SH X11-Basic as daemon:
The commandline option --daemon forces the interpreter to run in daemon-mode 
(with no terminal connected).
No prompt is given and the input is not echoed back. 

.SH X11-Basic as shell:
X11-Basic programs can be excecuted like shell scripts.
If the xbasic interpreter was installed in 
.I /bin/ 
any X11-Basic program with
.nf
 #!/bin/xbasic
.fi
in the first command line can be excecuted directly.
