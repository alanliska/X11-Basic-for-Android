.SH DESCRIPTION

X11-Basic is a dialect of the BASIC programming language with graphics.

X11-Basic uses a graphical user interface (GUI) which is very similar to the
ATARI ST TOS/GEM implementation. The *.gui file format, which is basically an
ASCII representation of the ATARI ST recource files (*.rsc), can be converted to
X11-Basic code, which then can handle message boxes and forms. For conversion of
ATARI ST recource files to *.gui Files see
.I rsc2gui(1).

.B gui2bas
can be used to make X11-Basic template programs out of gui Files, which
represent the Object structure of the Graphical User Interface which is
implemented into X11-Basic..

.PP
For a desciption of the X11-basic language and usage of the interpreter see
.I xbasic(1).

.SH The GUI file format

The *.gui file consists of Lines and Blocks which specify objects and their 
hirarchical dependencies.

The generic Format of such an object is:

label: TYPE(variables)

The label is optional and gives the object a name. Depending on TYPE of the
object, one or more variables are given as a comma separated list in brackets. 

Each Object may start a block with '{' at the end of the line. Inside this
block there might be one or more objects given which then are considered as
sub-objects of the one whichopened the block. The block will be closed by a '}'
in a single line.

Example:

.nf
BOX(X=0,Y=0,W=74,H=14, FRAME=2, FRAMECOL=1, TEXTCOL=1, BGCOL=0, PATTERN=0, TEXTMODE=0, STATE=OUTLINED+) {
