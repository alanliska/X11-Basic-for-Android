' Test of the matrix/linear equation solver function
' works only, if X11-Basic was compiled to use LAPACK.
'
' The matrix a() need not be square. The algorithm finds a solution
' in nearly any case. Even if there is no (exact) solution to the
' equation system.

' The returned vector is the one, which minimizes the error |a*x-b|
