.TH XB2C 1 04-Jan-2022 "Version 1.28" "X11-Basic"
.SH NAME
xb2c \- translate X11-Basic bytecode to C
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xb2c
.RI "[ " option " ] " 
[\fB\-o\fR \fIoutfile\fR]
.IR <filename>

.SH DESCRIPTION

X11-Basic is a dialect of the BASIC programming langage with graphics. 

.B xb2c
can be used to convert X11-Basic *.b bytecode binary files (produced with 
.I xbbc(1))
into C sourcecode, which can be compiled with the gnu C compiler 
.B gcc 
or any other ANSI C compiler, e.g. 
.B tcc\fR, 
the tiny c compiler. 
.PP
The sources depend on the 
.I x11basic.a 
or 
.I libx11basic.so 
libraries and on the header file 
.I xb2csol.h\fR, 
which therefore should be installed and linked. The
compiled programs will be faster than the interpreted ones and even a bit
faster than the bytecode processed ones (see 
.I xbbc(1)
and 
.I xbvm(1)\fR).
.PP
For a desciption of the X11-Basic language and usage of the interpreter see
.I xbasic(1).

.SH Filenames

Xb2c processes one input file. The suffix of the input file is usually .b 
(a bytecode file produced by
.I xbbc(1)
).
The default output file name is 
.I 11.c
but you can specify alternate names with the -o option.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-o " " \fIfile\fR
Place output in file \c
.I file\c
\&. This applies regardless to whatever
sort of output xb2c is producing.
If you do not specify `\|\c
.B \-o\c
\&\|', the default is to put the output into the file `\|\c
.B 11.c\c
\& .
.TP
.BR \-\-version
shows version, program and other information and exits.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
print a short help.

For detailed help and description of the implemented basic commands take a look
at the README file and the X11-Basic manual. 


.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
xbbc testme.bas -o testme.b
 produces a bytecode file testme.b
xb2c testme.b -o testme.c
 produces a file testme.c
gcc testme.c -o testme -lx11basic -ldl -lm -lasound -lreadline -lX11
 produces an excecutable file testme. However the same result can be optained by
xbc -virtualm testme.bas -o testme
 which does all the above steps.
.fi

You can find additional sample programs in 
.I /usr/share/doc/packages/X11Basic/examples.

.SH The basic to C translator

There is no way to recreate the .bas source code from the c file.. 
But still the c file is platform independant.

.SH VERSION
This Page was created for V.1.19

.SH BUG REPORTS  

If you find a bug in the X11-Basic to C translator, you should report it. But
first, you should make sure that it really is a bug, and that it appears in the
latest version of the X11-Basic package that you have.

Once you have determined that a bug actually exists, mail a bug report to
kollo@users.sourceforge.net. If you have a fix, you are welcome to mail that as
well! Suggestions may be mailed to the x11-basic bug tracking system.

Comments and bug reports concerning this manual page should be directed to
kollo@users.sourceforge.net.
