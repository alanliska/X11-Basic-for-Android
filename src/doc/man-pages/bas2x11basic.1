.SH NAME
bas2x11basic \- ANSI-Basic to X11-Basic converter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bas2x11basic

.SH DESCRIPTION

X11-Basic is a dialect of the BASIC programming language with graphics.

X11-Basic is a structured programming language. Structure is a form of visual
and functional encapsulation in which multiple line sections of a program  look
and act like single units. The beginning and end of blocks are marked by
descriptive keyword delimiters. Lines within blocks are generally indented to
make the block visible. Most important: X11-Basic does not use line numbers.

.B bas2x11basic
can be used to make X11-Basic template programs out of ANSI basic files. It
helps converting old (real) Basic Programs with line numbers and multiple
commands per line to the X11-Basic structure. Because there are so many
different BASIC versions and dialects around, in most cases you will have to edit
these files produced manually. But most of the work will already have been done
by this converter.

.PP
For a desciption of the X11-Basic language and usage of the interpreter see
.I xbasic(1)\fR.

.SH The ANSI Basic to X11-Basic converter

Actually this converter is not yet complete. Further improvenents may be applied
in future. Please let me know about ANSI-Basic programs which will not be
converted.

.SH VERSION
