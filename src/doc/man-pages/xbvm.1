.SH NAME
xbvm  \- X11-Basic bytecode interpreter / virtual machine 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xbvm
[\fB\-q\fR]
[\fB\-v\fR]
.RI "[ " options " ] " 
.IR <filename>

.SH DESCRIPTION

X11-Basic is a dialect of the BASIC programming language with graphics
capability. 

.B xbvm
can be used to execute bytecode-binaries which have been compiled with 
.I xbbc(1)
before. These bytecode 
files run about 10-20 times faster than the interpreted .bas files. 

.B xbvm
is a run-only interpreter, it has no interactive mode and no editing features.
It is possible to pack one BASIC program together with the virtual machine to 
form a single excecutable file. 

.PP
For a desciption of the X11-Basic language and usage of the interpreter see
.I xbasic(1).

.SH Filenames

.B xbvm 
processes one input file. The suffix of the input file is usually .b.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-q
be quiet and print less debug information. 
.TP
.BR \-v
be more verbose and print debug information. 
.TP
.BR \-\-version
shows version, program and other information and exits.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
print a short help and exit.
.PP
For detailed help and description of the implemented basic commands take a 
look at the README file coming with the package and the X11-Basic manual. 


.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
xbvm testme.b
xbvm -v testme.b
.fi


.SH The virtual machine
The virtual machine is an interpreter for bytecode. It implements a virtual 
stack machine on which the bytecode is excecuted. 
The bytecode is very compact  and similar to machine code, and it
is independant of the actual processor hardware and such very portable. With an
additional small step it can be translated to native assembler or machine code.
(For linux this is done by the 
.I xb2c(1) 
translator and 
.I gcc()).

The bytecode interpreter is highly optimized, so that the gain in excecution
speed is immense. Especially complex formulas are speed up by a factor 20. Last
but not least, there is no way to recreate the source code from the bytecode.

.SH BUG REPORTS       

If you find a bug in the X11-Basic virtual machine, you should report it. But
first, you should make sure that it really is a bug, and that it appears in
the latest version of the X11-Basic package that you have.

Once you have determined that a bug actually exists, mail a bug report to
kollo@users.sourceforge.net. If you have a fix, you are welcome to mail that
as well! Suggestions may be mailed to the bug tracking system.

Comments and bug reports concerning this manual page should be directed to
