.TH YBASIC 1 04-Jan-2022 "Version 1.28" "X11-Basic"
.SH NAME
ybasic \- The X11-Basic bytecode wrapper
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ybasic
[\fBfurther options\fR]
.IR <filename>

.SH DESCRIPTION

X11-Basic is a dialect of the BASIC programming language with graphics
capability.

.IR ybasic 
is a wrapper which compiles the given X11-Basic program 
.I <filename> 
to bytecode and then excecutes the X11-Basic interpreter
.B xbasic. 

The basic command-files (programs) 
usually have the extension .bas or .xbas.

Further options will be passed to the X11-Basic interpreter 
.B xbasic
as they are.

.PP
This little trick allows to run the BASIC programs as fast, as if they where 
compiled to bytecode before. With a little overhead of compile time at the 
beginning. The advantage is that you can keep the flexibility of editing the 
programs as if they where normal interpreted scripts.

.SH OPTIONS
The commandline options are the same as for 
.B xbasic .
Please see the man-page 
.I xbasic(1)
for details.
.PP
For detailed help and description of the implemented basic commands take a look
at the README file which comes with the X11-Basic package. There is also a full
users manual available as *.pdf file on the homepage.



.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
ybasic testme.bas
ybasic runfast.bas -f file.dat
.fi



.SH X11-Basic as shell:
X11-Basic programs can also be excecuted like shell scripts.
If the xbasic interpreter was installed in 
.I /bin/ 
any X11-Basic program with
.nf
 #!/bin/xbasic
.fi
or 
.nf
 #!/bin/ybasic
.fi

in the first command line can be excecuted directly.
