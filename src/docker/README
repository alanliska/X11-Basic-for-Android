Dockerfile for X11-Basic
========================

Dockerfile for X11-Basic based on the one by Bruno
https://github.com/shakenfr/x11basic_docker/

The docker file generates an installable .deb package of X11-Basic as well as
the User-Manul as .pdf

After a make docker you should find here:

Dockerfile.Ubuntu.20.04         -- The Dockerfile to generate the docker image, based on Ubunut.20.04
isetup-5.5.8.exe		-- InnoSetup installer (not really needed)
x11basic_1.28-64_amd64.deb	-- The debian package for X11-Basic for linux
X11-Basic-manual-1.28.pdf	-- The User Manual
X11-Basic-1.28-64-setup.exe	-- The Installer for WINDOWS
xbasic.mqtt			-- Version of X11-basic with MQTT support compiled in (for linux)
X11-Basic-1.28-64-st.zip	-- A .zip distribution with the ATARI-ST Version of X11-basic
xbasic.sdl			-- Version of X11-basic with SDL support compiled in (for linux)

You can run the docker container which would start xbasic. Make sure to 
connect the graphical display. I do it this way:

 
  XAUTHORITY=$(xauth info | grep "Authority file" | awk '{ print $3 }')
  echo $(XAUTHORITY)
  cd docker;sudo docker run -ti -v`pwd`:/work/ --net=host -e DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:ro \
            -v $(XAUTHORITY):/root/.Xauthority:ro kollo/$(DNAME):$(LIBNO)-$(RELEASE)
